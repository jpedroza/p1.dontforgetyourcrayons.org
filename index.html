<p>Growing up in Washington D.C., the world always seemed so big and confusing.  I frequently found myself sketching and drawing imaginary worlds that I would surely explore one day when I grew up.  Kindergarten to this day still makes my stomach hurt, just thinking of all the shapes and colors and decorations on the walls</p>
